# VulnerabilityScanner
 The Vulnerability Scanning Tool is a Python script for identifying potential security risks by scanning target hosts for open ports and common vulnerabilities.

Getting Started:
Clone or download the vulnerability_scanning.py file to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
Usage:
Run the script by executing the command python vulnerability_scanning.py.
Follow the prompts to enter the target host, start port, and end port.
The tool will scan the specified ports and display results on the console.
Note:
Ensure you have appropriate permissions to perform port scanning on the target host.
Use this tool responsibly and only on systems you have permission to scan.
Results may vary based on network conditions and target host configuration.
